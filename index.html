		<p>Basenjis are a great breed of<br> dog, usually referred to as the "Barkless" breed. They fit right in with family, and are a breed of dog that considers themselves part of your family. They are a heavily energetic breed of dog, and will expend that energy in any way possible. They can be very hard to train, but if you do it right you can make them learn fast. With that fastness comes it's intelligence. Some sides of this dog are that it will escape easily, and is also very intelligent, to the point that it can easily outsmart you. A relationship with a Basenji would be one of mutualism, not superiority, as superiority can lead to escape. These dogs require careful observation and time, but they are great companions.</p>
